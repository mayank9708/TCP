1. Abstract
A brief summary of the research paper, including the main focus, key points, and outcomes of the study on the TCP three-way handshake.

2. Introduction
Importance of TCP/IP in Networking:
Explains why TCP/IP is essential for communication between devices in a network.

Overview of the Three-Way Handshake:
Gives a basic idea of how the handshake process works to establish a connection between two devices.

Objectives of the Research:
Outlines the goals of the paper, such as understanding the handshake process, identifying security risks, and exploring improvements.

3. Background and Related Work
Overview of TCP:
Describes what TCP is and how it helps in reliable data transfer.

Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless Communication:
Compares TCP (connection-oriented) with protocols like UDP (connectionless).

Past Studies and Security Research:
Mentions previous research done on TCP handshake and related security issues.

4. Three-Way Handshake Mechanism
Step-by-step Explanation:
Detailed description of each step in the three-way handshake process (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

Packet Structure & Sequence Numbers:
Discusses how TCP packets are structured and how sequence numbers ensure proper communication.

Role in Reliable Communication:
Explains how this process ensures that data is reliably sent and received.

5. Security Concerns
SYN Flood Attacks:
Describes how attackers can flood a server with SYN requests to disrupt service.

MITM Attacks:
Explains how a middle attacker can intercept or alter data during transmission.

TCP Spoofing & Session Hijacking:
Discusses how attackers fake IP addresses or take over a session.

Defensive Mechanisms:
Covers solutions like SYN cookies, rate limiting, and firewalls to prevent attacks.

6. Enhancements and Alternatives
TCP Fast Open:
A modern method to speed up the connection process.

QUIC vs TLS Handshake:
Compares newer protocols like QUIC and how they handle handshakes differently.

Use of AI/ML in Attack Detection:
Talks about how machine learning can help detect and stop handshake-based attacks.

7. Case Studies & Implementation
Real-World Use Cases:
Shows where and how the TCP handshake is used in real networking scenarios.

Wireshark Analysis:
Uses Wireshark tool to analyze and visualize TCP handshake packets.

Cloud Platform Implementations (AWS, Azure):
Describes how TCP handshake works in cloud services like AWS and Azure.

8. Conclusion & Future Scope
Summarizes the main findings of the research, suggests ways to make TCP handshakes more secure, and discusses possible future developments in this area.
